### Derivatives of Polynomials

[Polynomials](gloss:polynomial) are some of the simplest functions we use. We
need to know the derivatives of polynomials such as `x^4+3x`, `8x^2+3x+6`,
and 2. Let's start with the easiest of these, the function `y=f(x)=c`, where `c`
is any constant, such as 2, 15.4, or one million and four (`10^6+4`). It turns
out that the derivative of any constant function is zero. This makes sense if
you think about the derivative as the slope of a tangent line. To use the
definition of a derivative, with `f(x)=c`,

For completeness, now consider `y=f(x)=x`. This is the equation of a straight
line with slope 1, and we expect to find this from the definition of the
derivative. We are not disappointed:

Here is an example:

::: column(width=320)

    x-coordinate-system(width=320 height=320 x-axis="-4|3|1")

::: column(width=320)

    x-coordinate-system(width=320 height=320 x-axis="-4|3|1")

## Classroom Activities
> section: activities
> id: activities

::: .theorem

Help your students apply the learned concepts through a hands-on classroom
activity [Mauna Loa Yearly Average CO2](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/obop/mlo/)
by Thomas J. Pfaff at Sustainability Math. This activity uses atmospheric CO2
data from the Mauna Loa site for the period 1950 to 2017.

This activity will help students to
* observe the trend in increasing atmospheric CO2 levels
* infer the approximate year when atmospheric CO2 levels could cause global
  temperatures to increase by 2°C (leading to serious climate change-related
  problems)
* determine the desired trends in atmospheric CO2 levels that could help in
  avoiding or mitigating such climate change-related consequences.

::: .theorem

Download the material in the project [Mauna Loa Yearly Average CO2](http://sustainabilitymath.org/calculus-materials/), under Calculus I – Differentiation Related Projects.

*  Conduct the exercises 1-6 to predict atmospheric CO2 levels in the future.
  (Optional: exercises 7 and 8).
* Discuss the possible impact of these trends on global temperature and climate.

:::

* Solve the exercises 1-6 on this sheet: [Exercises](http://sustainabilitymath.org/word/Mauna-Loa-CO2.docx)
* You will need this data: [Excel file](http://sustainabilitymath.org/excel/Mauna-Loa-CO2.xlsx)

## Questions and Assignments
> section: exercises
> id: exercises

::: .theorem
Propose the following questions to your students and help them to find some answers.
:::

Use the tools and the concepts learned so far to discuss and determine answers to the following questions:

1. Plot a graph and find the polynomial equation to model the average yearly
   atmospheric CO2 levels from 1950 to 2017 (using data records provided).
2. Compare and analyze the rate of change of atmospheric CO2 levels by applying
   Polynomial Differentiation.
3. Based on observed trends, what will the atmospheric CO2 level be in 2100?
