## Classroom Activities
> section: activities
> id: activities

::: .theorem
__Classroom/Laboratory activities (50 min)__


* Explore the topic in further detail through a classroom/laboratory activity [“Introducing the economic concept of ‘tragedy of the commons’ using global warming”](https://serc.carleton.edu/integrate/programs/implementation/program2/activities/135953.html), by Laura Triplett, from Gustavus Adolphus College.
* In this activity, students will discuss case studies for different tragedy-of-the-commons problems. Then, they will examine Earth’s atmosphere as a commons and global warming as a tragedy, and will propose economic solutions to solve this tragedy.
* Download the Teaching Materials and conduct the activity described on the page.

## Reading

::: .theorem

__Reading (60 min)__


* Read [“Climate Change: The Ultimate Tragedy of the Commons”](https://www.lincolninst.edu/sites/default/files/pubfiles/climate-change_0.pdf) by Jouni Paavola in “Property in Land and Other Resources”.

* This reading describes climate change as a tragedy of the commons problem (atmospheric sinks for greenhouse gases are the commons) and analyzes the current state of climate change governance. It also discusses polycentricity as a governance approach to address global climate change at various levels and scales, providing specific examples ofthe Cities for Climate Change program and the Cement Sustainability Initiative.

::: .theorem
Propose the following questions to your students and help them to find some answers.
:::

Use the tools and the concepts learned so far to discuss and determine answers to the following questions:

1. Describe the concept of tragedy of the commons.
2. Discuss climate change as a tragedy-of-the-commons problem. Identify the “commons” and the “tragedy”.
3. Explain why “atmospheric sinks for greenhouse gases” can be considered as a “commons”.
4. Discuss different types of governance solutions for climate change as a tragedy of the commons. Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each type of solution.
