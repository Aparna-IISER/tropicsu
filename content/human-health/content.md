# Malaria and Human Health

## Introduction
> section: intro
> id: intro

::: .theorem

The tools in this lesson plan will enable students to:

* enumerate some vectors and the diseases that they cause
* discuss the causes for the spread of vector-borne diseases
* explain the possible link between climate change and the distribution/spread of infectious vector-borne diseases
* discuss climate change-related actions and policies that will help in adapting to and mitigating the spread of vector-borne diseases

:::

Malaria is a disease caused by _Plasmodium_ protozoa, and it is transmitted by the bite of the female _Anopheles_ mosquito. This illness affects the human liver and blood and kills one-to-two million people every year.

Many factors limit the spread of the disease, foremost of which may be the temperature. Malaria generally spreads into regions where minimum temperatures fall no lower than 16° C (61° F).

Global changes in the climate and temperature affect the risks of spreading Malaria in different regions.

::: .theorem

__Reading (20-30 min)__

Introduce the topic with the help of a reading

* Have your students to read “Vector-borne diseases”, a fact sheet from the World Health Organization (WHO).

* With the help of the reading, introduce the topic of vector-borne diseases and the factors that influence their distribution and spread.

* Proceed to explain malaria (or another vector-borne disease) and its transmission.

* Discuss the environmental conditions that are conducive for the spread of malaria (or another vector-borne disease).

## Video Lesson
> section: video
> id: video

::: .theorem
__Video (8 min)__

Play the video "Human Health, Vector-Borne Diseases, and Climate Change", which can be used as a  micro-lecture.
:::

In this video, "Human Health, Vector-Borne Diseases, and Climate Change", Mary Hayden and Andy Monaghan from the National Center for Atmospheric Research discuss the role of weather and climate as one of the factors that could impact the spread of diseases, thus potentially affecting human health outcomes.

## Classroom Activities
> section: activities
> id: activities

::: .theorem
__Classroom/Laboratory activities (60-90 min)__

Explore the topic in an engaging manner by conducting the activity, “Beyond the Bite: Mosquitoes & Malaria”, developed by Institute for Global Environmental Strategies.

* Download the activity [“Beyond the Bite: Mosquitoes & Malaria”](/resources/human-health/downloads/mosquitoes-and-malaria.pdf).

* Print the maps and other data sheets for your students.

* Conduct the activity in the classroom or laboratory by following the procedure described in the 
downloaded file.

:::

The activity [“Beyond the Bite: Mosquitoes & Malaria”](/resources/human-health/downloads/mosquitoes-and-malaria.pdf) explores how changes in the minimum temperatures of some regions can affect the transmission of Malaria.

## Questions and Assignments
> section: exercises
> id: exercises

::: .theorem
Propose the following questions to your students and help them to find some answers.
:::

Use the tools and the concepts learned so far to discuss and determine answers to the following questions:

1. What are the major vector-borne diseases and their symptoms? What is the current geographical distribution of these diseases globally?

2. Explain whether climate-related factors influence the distribution and spread of vector-borne diseases.

3. How could an increase in the average global temperature affect the geographical distribution of malaria?

4. Recommend specific actions/policies that can help in mitigating the spread of vector-borne diseases caused by a rise in average global temperature, increase in sea-levels, and growth in population.
